# Login Template

## Description

this project is designed to be a minimal login/sign-up template. It uses a SolidJs as a front-end frameword and bulma for a css library.

the goal is to create a light-weight and reuseable login page that can be used anywhere. It is also my intention to build this as fast and simply as possible.

It is also a practice project to learn a few new technologies.
